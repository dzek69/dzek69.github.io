    <h2>Event names and data</h2>
</header>

<article>
    <h1>Explaination - missing information in <code>react-native-voice</code> docs</h1><p>In my opinion <code>react-native-voice</code> fails to properly document available events, their meaning, triggering order that
should be expected and data received with events. Read on for missing documentation on this.</p>
<h2>Events list and their meaning</h2><blockquote>
<p>Note: This was verified on Android device only. iOS experiments will be documented here later.</p>
<p>Note: Nothing here is guaranted to be true, everything here is a documented result of experiments.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>start</h3><p><code>start</code> looks like a indicator that voice is</p>
<ul>
<li>started being recorded by device</li>
<li>started being sent over to recognition server</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this means <code>start</code> <strong>is triggered twice</strong> on successful voice recognition.
<code>start</code> is triggered once on erroneous voice recognition, when there is no Internet connection.</p>
<h3>end</h3><p><code>end</code> looks like indicator that sound is no longer being sent to recognition server. Recognition still happens on
server after the event is triggered.</p>
<p>This means <code>end</code> <strong>is NOT triggered</strong> on erroneous voice recognition, when there is no Internet connection.
<code>end</code> will however be triggered when there was no words recognized.
<code>end</code> will be also triggered when sending data to server was started but was interrupted (lost connection).</p>
<h3>volumeChanged</h3><p><code>volumeChanged</code> is triggered many times, every few ms. It is all over between other events. It's usually triggered few
times before <code>start</code>, it's triggered few times after <code>end</code> and even after <code>results</code>. Doesn't look useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Currently all events after <code>results</code> or <code>error</code> events are muted and unlistenable due to actions this wrapper
does to differentiate which instance should receive the event. Usually this means few <code>volumeChanged</code> events to be
skipped. This is not very useful as after <code>results</code> or <code>error</code> events voice recognition is stopped anyway.</p>
<p>This may change in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>partialResults</h3><p><code>partialResults</code> is usually triggered few times during recognition.</p>
<h3>results</h3><p><code>results</code> is the final result of recognition.</p>
<h3>recognized</h3><p>It seems to never be triggered, <code>react-native-voice</code> notes that it should be triggered on both iOS and Android.</p>
<h3>error</h3><p><code>error</code> is triggered when recognition fails due to no connection or connection broken in the middle. Probably triggered
when server fails for some reason too.</p>
<h2>Data of events</h2><blockquote>
<p>Note: This was verified on Android device only. iOS experiments will be documented here later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general - data structure of events data are always the same. So you don't need to worry that instead of object
you'll get null or object without expected <code>value</code> key but with <code>error</code> key instead.</p>
<h3>start</h3><pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>{ error: false }</code></pre><p>Always just this.</p>
<h3>end</h3><pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>{ error: false }</code></pre><p>Always just this, even when connection fails.</p>
<h3>volumeChanged</h3><pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>{ value: VALUE_HERE }</code></pre><p>In general - <code>VALUE_HERE</code> seems to be positive value when device hears something (the bigger the value - the louder 
the sound) and negative when there is silence.
However the values seems to be hardcoded into few constants:</p>
<ul>
<li>on silence:<ul>
<li><code>-2.119999885559082</code></li>
<li><code>-2</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>on voice:<ul>
<li><code>1.6000001430511475</code></li>
<li><code>2.8000001907348633</code></li>
<li><code>4</code></li>
<li><code>5.200000286102295</code></li>
<li><code>6.399999618530273</code></li>
<li><code>8.799999237060547</code></li>
<li><code>10</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>partialResults</h3><pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>{ value: [&quot;&quot;] }</code></pre><p>The array length is always <code>1</code>, but the string may be empty.</p>
<h3>results</h3><pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>{
    value: [
        &quot;possible value number one&quot;,
        &quot;possible value number two&quot;,
    ]
}</code></pre><p>This array has length of 1 or more. If recognition server is unsure what was said - it sends few possible texts as a
whole sentence.</p>
<h3>recognized</h3><p>It seems to never be triggered, despite <code>react-native-voice</code> notes that it should be triggered on both iOS and Android.
Anyway, accorting to original documentation it should contain always just this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>{ error: false }</code></pre><h3>error</h3><pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>{ error: &quot;1/Description&quot; }</code></pre><p>Object with <code>error</code> property that contains a string with error message in format:</p>
<ul>
<li>code</li>
<li>slash</li>
<li>description in English</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually: <code>7/No match</code></p>
<h2>Order of events</h2><blockquote>
<p>Remember about <code>volumeChanged</code>, it may happen anytime between those events.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>In case of success:</h3><ol>
<li><code>start</code> - triggered twice (see explanation above),</li>
<li><code>partialResults</code>, usually triggered multiple times when partially recognized text is available,</li>
<li><code>end</code>,</li>
<li><code>partialResults</code> may still be triggered now, probably because while recognition stops and no data is send to server
anymore the server may still push the data for previously received voice data,</li>
<li><code>results</code> - final results.</li>
</ol>
<h3>In case of error (voice not recognized):</h3><ol>
<li><code>start</code> - triggered twice (see explanation above),</li>
<li><code>end</code>,</li>
<li><code>partialResults</code> (with empty string, but may not be triggered)</li>
<li><code>error</code> - final results.</li>
</ol>
<h3>In case of error (no Internet connection since beginning):</h3><ol>
<li><code>start</code> - triggered once,</li>
<li><code>error</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>In case of error during recognition (connection lost in the middle):</h3><ol>
<li><code>start</code> - triggered usually twice, may be triggered once if connection is lost just after starting the recognition,</li>
<li><code>partialResults</code>, may not be triggered if connection is lost quickly, may be triggered multiple times,</li>
<li><code>end</code> (probably only if <code>start</code> was triggered twice),</li>
<li><code>error</code> - usually there is few seconds gap between <code>end</code> and <code>error</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>In case of <code>stop</code>ping recognition in the middle:</h3><blockquote>
<p>Stopping means just forcing recognizer to think that nothing is being said anymore.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If something was recognized before stopping - events will be the same as in success case.</li>
<li>If nothing was recognized before stopping - events will be the same as in error.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In case of <code>cancel</code>ling recognition in the middle:</h3><blockquote>
<p>Cancelling means ignoring everything - stopping in the middle with no ending events being sent.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If something was recognized before cancelling - events will be the same as in success case, but <code>end</code> and <code>results</code> will
never be triggered.</li>
<li>If nothing was recognized before cancelling - only <code>start</code> event will be triggered.</li>
</ul>
